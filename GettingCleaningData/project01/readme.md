One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/) . 

Fitbit, Nike, Jawbone Up... are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.
The data used here, are collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
 

## Getting started

This repository includes: 

        * R script: run_Analysis.R 
        * a codebook of the tidy data set produced with run_Analysis.R
        * readme.Rmd


## Running the script

    * Clone this repository
    * Download the data set and extract it under the UCI HAR Dataset folder
      https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
    * Change current directory to the UCI HAR Dataset folder.
    * Run Rscript: run_analysis.R
    * The tidy data sets should get created in the current directory

The script normally runs for 2min.
